Feature: Get user information
  This feature file describes the behaviour of the system for GET requests at the endpoint on /api/users to get a list of users
  There should be following behaviour at the system:
  - If the request contains the header "Authorization" with a valid token, then the http response body will contain a list of 3 users, sorted in first grade by their userName, in second grade by their firstName and in third grade by their lastName and the http response status-code will be 200
  - If the QueryParam "numUsers" is specified, then the number of returned users will be the value of the param "numUsers", if there are enough users
  - If the QueryParam "searchString" is specified, then the returned list of users contains just users whos userName, firstName or lastName contains the value of the searchString
  - If the QueryParam "index" is specified, then its value will be the starting index to get the n users from the sorted list of matching users for the response if there are enough matching users persisted
  - If the QueryParam "numUsers" isn´t specified, then its default value will be 5
  - If the QueryParam "searchString" isn´t specified, then its default value will be ''
  - If the request doesn´t contain a valid token, then the http response status-code will be 401

  Background: Persist accounts
    Given the user "max" is authenticated
    Given the moderator "werner" is authenticated
    Given the system has persisted accounts
      | accountId | userName | firstName | lastName   | role      |
      | 0         | max      | Max       | Mustermann | USER      |
      | 1         | marta    | Marta     | Musterfrau | USER      |
      | 2         | john     | John      | Doe        | USER      |

      | 5         | karl     | Karl      | Ranseier   | USER      |
      | 6         | lena     | Lena      | Löchte     | USER      |




  Scenario: User requests user information
  Requesting users sorted in first grad by their userName,
  in second grade by their firstName and in third grade by their lastName

    When a client sends a GET "/users" request for user "max" to get a list of users
    Then the client will receive the "OK" Status Code
    And the HTTP response body contains following JSON with a list of users
      """
      [
          {
              "userId": 3,

  Scenario: Moderator requests user information
  Requesting users sorted in first grad by their userName,
  in second grade by their firstName and in third grade by their lastName

    When a client sends a GET "/users" request for moderator "werner" to get a list of users
    Then the client will receive the "OK" Status Code

  Scenario Outline: Change query params for request to get users
  The QueryParam numUsers represents the number of requested users
  The default value for numUsers will be 3
  The QueryParam index represents the number of users to be skipped for the response from a list of users sorted by their username, firstName and lastName in presented order
  The default value for index will be 0
  The QueryParam searchString represents a string which must be containing in the userName, firstName or lastName

    When a client sends a GET "/users" request for user "max" to get a list of users with following QueryParameter
      | queryParam: | searchString   | numTweets   | index   |
      | value:      | <searchString> | <numTweets> | <index> |
    Then the returned users will be the users with ids <returnedUsers> in presented order

      Examples: Without any query parameters setted
        | searchString | index      | numTweets  | returnedUsers |
        | not setted   | not setted | not setted | 3,2,5         |

      Examples: Just numTweets is setted
        | searchString | index      | numTweets  | returnedUsers |
        | not setted   | not setted | 4          | 3,2,5,6       |
        | not setted   | not setted | 6          | 3,2,5,6,1,0   |
        | not setted   | not setted | 7          | 3,2,5,6,1,0   |

      Examples: Just index is setted
        | searchString | index      | numTweets  | returnedUsers |
        | not setted   | 0          | not setted | 3,2,5         |
        | not setted   | 1          | not setted | 2,5,6         |
        | not setted   | 5          | not setted | 0             |
        | not setted   | 6          | not setted |               |

      Examples: Just searchString is setted
        | searchString | index      | numTweets  | returnedUsers |
        | Mustermann   | not setted | not setted | 0             |
        | mustermann   | not setted | not setted |               |
        | ma           | not setted | not setted | 1,0           |

      Examples: Combined query parameters
        | searchString | index      | numTweets  | returnedUsers |
        | ma           | 1          | not setted | 0             |
        | ma           | not setted | 1          | 1             |
        | not setted   | 2          | 2          | 5,6           |
        | not setted   | 3          | 2          | 6,1           |
        | not setted   | 3          | 3          | 6,1,0         |
        | not setted   | 3          | 4          | 6,1,0         |




  Scenario: Unauthorised request to get a list of users
  The request must contain a valid token from an account to get a list of users

    When a client sends a GET "/users" request without a valid token to get a list of users with following QueryParameter
    Then the client will receive the "UNAUTHORIZED" Status Code
